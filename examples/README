----------------------
Running ViennaTS
----------------------

$> ./viennats [parameters_file]

All simulation and grid parameters are passed through the parameters file.
This includes the location of the input geometry file which, for the examples given, is located in the same directory as the parameters file.

----------------------
Directory
----------------------

The location of the input geometry file is given in the parameters file.
Since this path is relative, all examples must be executed from within the folder where the parameters file and geometry file are located.

----------------------
SiO2 Etching Example
----------------------

The input geometry file is: examples/SiO2_Etching/SiO2_etch.dx
The parameters file is: examples/SiO2_Etching/par_2d.txt

This example is run by first traversing into the examples/SiO2_Etching/ folder and then running ViennaTS:

$> cd examples/SiO2_Etching/
$> ../../build/viennats par_2d.txt
